- "infrastructure as code (staging, dev, prod are identical)"
- ephemeral servers!
- no local storage! (no tmp files)
- yo ephemeral storage is crayyyyzzzy
- + no local deploys needed, can "just refresh a bookmarked url"
- "expanded access to file services"
- "are mission critical services better in the cloud?"
- reduced workload on devops staff ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
- travis has deployment tools for green checks
- "code pipeline" / beanstalk
- cloud will be $$ but how about what our costs are now
- how do you know that this deployment is ok for this environment
- gem install `okcomputer`
  - adds a `/status` url that can be used to check
- shipping configuration w/ code
  - `.eb` extensions directory
- can treat aws as a vm farm _or_ rewrite to embrace its services
- "how do you handle secrets?"
- "so many aws services, difficult to choose the right one"
- nd has preservation tape storage on campus, how to save things there
  + cache(?) in the cloud

- understand beanstalk + how it works
- github -> ci greenlight -> deploy (code-pipeline -> beanstalk)
- cloudformation
- don't try to deploy everything at once!! piece by piece
  - fedora
  - postgres
  - solr
  - etc.
- "can't assume anything about the environment"
- rails-config can take env variables, which allows you to set settings
  in aws but also use a local dev environment
