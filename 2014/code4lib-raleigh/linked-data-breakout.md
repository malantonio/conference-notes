bibframe / linked data breakout
-------------------------------
* future of data publishing? useful to have a framework
* rdf = web standard for data
* having yr resources free of a cms? framework doesn't have to change if the system changes
* ny conversion tool into web portals. GLAMs. 
* !!schema.org!! -> starts from simple vs. rdf which started complex
* simplicity of dublin core + more complexities
* many differing ontologies
* hey adam, you're not alone in disliking marc
* schema.org list
* dbpedia?
* "contributer", "role"
* marc -> bibframe converter online
* rda introduces new concepts not represented well in marc
* oldschool catalogers feel their field's been handed over to IT
* linked data jazz project
* freebase as an example -> typeahead
* right-hand side of google search results
* catalogers _don't_ have to go out and find links there are tools for it
* punctuation / syntax not as necessary in ld -> less probability of error: selecting things from list, will help w/ cleaner
* find quality sources -> marc's been around forever, ld will get there with time
* rda vs. rdf
* if you can attach an id, _DO IT_, you can go back and revisit it
* digital humanities, handling data -> how to share the data associated w/ papers published?
* ownership of scholarly work?
* bibframe's applicability to moving images or audio?
* open metadata registry, helpful w/ zine library
