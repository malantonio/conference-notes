Problems w/ long search queries
-------------------------------
spawned from a lightning talk about full citation discovery searches not returning results

* wcl search logs? if not available, how could we catch it? catch number of matches too?
    * can we embed js in wcl?
* filtering out common citation 'clues': peer-reviewed, vol, iss, pp., etc.?
* removing punctuation
* suggest cleaned up search?
* "this looks like a citation" text
* fetch article on DOI
* scrub out urls if entered (non proxied email links accessed off campus)
* missed search box b/c auto-focus?
* could also double as citation finder (easier than multi-part form we have now)
* articles vs. books
* bento? (bento-like rails app for special collections, jason renalo(sp?))
* regex out date, vol, issue numbers
* citation taught as most important part
* affecting relevancy
* track for keywords and promote a 'did you mean' type box w/ link (eg. for hours (link or actual))
* database recommendation?
* libguides 2.0, improved api?
* subject recommender? (basically our libguides?)
