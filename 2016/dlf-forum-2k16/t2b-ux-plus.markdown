From stacks to screen: prototyping the future of Wellcome's digital library
==========

**presenter:** Jenn Phillips-Bacher

- @WellcomeLibrary
- ALCHEMY + WITCHCRAFT ITEMS IN THE COLLECTION
- "people aren't finding the stuff" re: discovery
	- 80k items never viewed
	- 18k items viewed between 1-10 times
	- 27 items viewed more than 1000 times
		- typically things embedded on site / blog post by hand
	- (based on 100k sample, may '16)
- whatsinthelibrary.com / alpha.wellcomelibrary.org
- "show the thing" : constant reprise
- use lcsh for subject pages
- use lcsh genre for "format" pages
- use lc authority for people + pull first two lines of biography from wikipedia
- "this way to FREE chocolate (if you help us test a website for 10 minutes)"
	- 15 min interviews
- "nice to have digitised items displayed as thumbnails so you can scan and find
	graphics and images but how do i go from page to page?"
	- desire to combine paged book + pinterest
- design challenge: what's between the covers
	- pretty rote at this point
- matters of taste + privacy
	- terms + conditions popup for material under 100 years old
- "people don't know what we have. the best thing to do is show them we have it"

Coordinated Discovery across Different Types of Resources
==========

**presenters:** Bruce Barton, Peter Gorman

- "bucketed" searching
	- different resources have different behaviors
	- difficult to rank results from differing metadata schemes
	- may not be able to merge results form external indexes
- ((seems like the common consensus for work-level pages is to keep the 
  work viewer @ top, span 100%, and metadata rests underneat
- what does google do that we can borrow?
	- other buckets available at top
	- forwards search to other buckets
		- search term, click `images` + that term is searched in images, and
			onward
	- "search propagation" check other buckets in the background + advertise
		close matches
- "we also suggest" sidebar where google would keep ad space
	- articles, databases, etc. within the catalog bucket
- facets stored in bar @ top of results
- https://www.library.wisc.edu/
- closeness evaluation techniques
	- levenshtein distance (string matching on titles) / jaccard index
		(names into n-gram shingles) / lucene (spell check)

Snapshot - Ensuring User Needs Before DAM Repository Implementation
==========

**presenter:** Kate Thornhill

- library's job is to oversee items in the repository, not own or control
- "library is switzerland"
- ndsa // cc lifecycle model
- present stakeholders w/ two options (not like 18)
- personas
	- look to design to apply system designers/product managers use to create
	  library personas
