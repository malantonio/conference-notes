- aapb collabo btwn wgbh + lib of congress
- http://americanarchive.org
  - >50,000 hrs of content
- https://github.com/WGBH/AAPB2 (i think this is just the current landing page)
- currently using an older custom-built archival management system
- displays only the parent works (not instantiations) on search results.
  in solr, child works are indexed onto the parent work so they'll show
  as a match.
